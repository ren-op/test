# Happy valentines day, my love
You have been one of the best things that has ever happened in my life. I am so lucky to have you. Every moment I spend with you i would always get the feeling of happiness, and you always find a way to brighten up my mood. I simply cannot imagine a world without you.

Your beauty, both inside and out, never fails to leave me captivated. The way that you're kind, caring, and the way you treat others are just some of the many reasons I keep falling in love with you every single day.

I want to keep on loving you till the day we get old and have white hair together. I just wanna be with you for the rest of my life, cristel.

In every universe, i would always choose you, my love. 

I love you so much
